Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

# Classic Arcade Game Clone
## About the game
### Player
* In this game you have a Player, a Bug, Enemies and obstacles. The goal of the player is to reach the star square, while holding the bug. Doing this you should avoid colliding into any of the enemies. Player can't enter the water. The player can move left, right, up and down, unless there will be rocks on his way. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once the player collides with an enemy, the number of hearts will go down by one till last one disappear. Which will be the same moment when game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player picks up the bug and reaches the star square with last heart stand, the game moves to level 2 which finishes the game.
### Interface
* In this panel Player can navigate right, left between buttons: the choice is to start the game or help's content. Enter button allows access.
